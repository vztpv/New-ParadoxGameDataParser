# New-ParadoxGameSaveDataParser
NOT YET! - Sequential Lexing? and Parallel Parsing. Only SavedGameData ( exactly Clausewitz Engine Game Data file with NO COMMENT ) 

# This is experimental.

# To Do : Parallel Lexing + Parallel Parsing?

# Maybe 
parallel parsing for json file?

# But, it takes many memory, and effect of parallel is small? 
#                         just about 1 second ( for 50MB file )?

# Parallel Parsing Idea
NOT YET!
